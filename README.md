- Hi, I’m Fernando Roa O. @fernandoroa
- Email: froao@unal.edu.co

I created this profile when I started working for a company, previously I was @ferroao.  
I will migrate from that to this profile.  
I also use gitlab.

I am open to work.  
I have worked with Shiny Apps, for personal projects for several years and in Pharmaceutical apps in the industry for one year
