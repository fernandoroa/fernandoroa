- Hi, I’m Fernando Roa O. @fernandoroa

I created this profile when I started working for a company, previously I was @ferroao in github.

I have migrated from that to this profile.

I also use gitlab. https://gitlab.com/ferroao

I have worked with Shiny Apps, for personal/academic projects for several years, and in Pharmaceutical apps in the industry for one year
